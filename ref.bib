	abstract = {Foodways of every colonizing European group changed in the New World, but, before the changes can be assessed, it is necessary to know what foods and food-related artifacts were common and available in the mother countries. Dutch foodways can be described using documents, excavated artifacts, and genre paintings. New York City began as a Dutch colony, and its foodways in the 17th century reflected this origin. Modifications in Dutch-American utilization of European domestic plants and animals were similar to changes in neighboring British colonies, but artifacts, specifically ceramics, remained recognizably Dutch well after the British annexation of the colony in 1664.},

	abstract = {Supervised machine learning is the classification of new data based on already classified training examples. In this work, we show that the support vector machine, an optimized binary classifier, can be implemented on a quantum computer, with complexity logarithmic in the size of the vectors and the number of training examples. In cases where classical sampling algorithms require polynomial time, an exponential speedup is obtained. At the core of this quantum big data algorithm is a nonsparse matrix exponentiation technique for efficiently performing a matrix inversion of the training data inner-product (kernel) matrix.},
