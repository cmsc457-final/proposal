\section{Motivation}
In deciding our motivation for the final project we opted to look at how
classical machine learning algorithms can be translated into the quantum field. 
More specifically the team is looking at either a Bayesian Network model or
Decision Tree/Random Forest approach. Although our topic is quite general right 
now the team hopes to narrow it down based upon research and Professor Wuâ€™s
input. The ultimate goal is to find a niche/specific area the team can focus 
on with regards to these topics. This could possibly be theory based or more 
implementation based using code depending on where the research takes us. 

\section{Existing Literature}

There exists substantial existing literature describing machine learning
as well as specific machine learning models in the context of quantum
computing.
